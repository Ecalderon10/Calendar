# Calendar


1. When completeing this daily planneer i first started with the time blocks in the html

2.Once getting the proper times i used id's and classes in order to set them up properly for my js

3.Css style was already pre-saved for this assignment no modification other than colors were changed

4. When doing the js i used jquery and all of the attributes needed to set it up properly

5. First i created all of my vairables which were times 9am -5pm

6.After creating my variables i focused on a functions using moment() 

7.After that a i created a function for the 'save btn' to function and to save the text to local storage.

8. Next i created a function to allow the color to change once time had passed that certain point in time using a past/present/future function

9. Once this was completed my planner had all the right functions in order to work properly
